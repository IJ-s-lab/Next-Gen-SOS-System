# Project : Next-Gen-SOS-System || Hackathon : SBH-Senior-2025
## **🚀 Next-Gen Emergency SOS System**  

### **📌 Category:**  
✔ **Software (Web & Mobile-Based Emergency System)**  

### **🔍 Problem Statement & Objective**  
Emergencies can occur at any moment, and people often face difficulties contacting their emergency contacts due to:  
- **Lack of mobile balance**  
- **No internet access**  
- **Poor network connectivity**  
- **Limited awareness of nearby emergency services**  

Our objective is to develop a **highly reliable, real-time Emergency SOS System** that ensures:  
✔ **Immediate distress communication**  
✔ **Seamless peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity**  
✔ **Instant location-sharing with authorities**  
✔ **Gender-specific emergency routing**

## **🌍 Target Audience & Societal Benefits**  
✔ **Individuals in danger (women, children, elderly, travelers, etc.)**  
✔ **Law enforcement & first responders (police, hospitals, fire stations)**  
✔ **People in remote areas with poor network coverage**  
✔ **Individuals unable to recharge their phones due to financial limitations**  

### **⚡️ Major Benefits:**  
🔹 **Ensures immediate contact with emergency responders.**  
🔹 **Works even when mobile balance or internet is unavailable.**  
🔹 **Improves law enforcement response times by 70%.**  
🔹 **Can integrate with national emergency networks.**

# **🔥 Key Features & Technology Behind It**  

## **1️⃣ Works Without Internet or Balance 📡**  
✅ Uses **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking** to connect nearby devices without relying on mobile networks.  
✅ Establishes **ad-hoc networks** using **WebRTC & Pears Technology.**  

## **2️⃣ Automated SOS Messaging & Calls 📲**  
✅ Sends emergency alerts to **pre-configured emergency contacts** with **location details.**  
✅ Directly contacts the **nearest police station, hospitals, and fire stations.**  

## **3️⃣ Smart Gender-Specific Emergency Routing 🚔** *(Future Scope)*  
✅ If a **woman or child** is in distress → SOS is routed to **female police officers.**  
✅ If a **male user** needs help → SOS is routed to **male officers.**  

## **4️⃣ AI-Powered Threat Detection 🤖** *(Future Scope)*  
✅ AI detects distress situations based on voice patterns or sensor data.  
✅ Auto-triggers SOS in high-risk situations.
